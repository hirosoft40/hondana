## My biggest challenge

This project was difficult to start with due to lack of my knowledge especially on Redux. Luckily, I was able to find many websites which shows same project in React/Redux. So I started learning by looking at those references. On the second day, I found myself that I was just copying those code and not understanding Redux.

So I decide to re-start from fresh. I stopped thinkin and planning on Actions and Reducers and started coding with React where I felt comfortable with. Then there was a moment that I had to lift up the state, and I knew it was my time to implement Redux.

I was not clear on "mapStateToProps" and "mapDispatchToProps" at first. After spending good amount of time on debugging mainly on Action not passing value to State, I now feel much comfortable with Redux.

My other challenge was Material-ui. I like their Icon buttons and I enjoyed reading their samples code as I was able to learn about defining classNames first on top to make it easier when re-using components. However, it was more complecated and I ended up stying with CSS a lot as I like it and I am familiar with it.
